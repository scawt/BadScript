' An Excel Macro to read and interpret narcotic dispensing data from Omnicell PCR reports, and compare it to AIMS anesthesia records.
' Both programs write out data in a spreadsheet that I would conservatively describe as "whack," so I built a workbook to read them
' for me. Omnicell report goes in a sheet named "Ocra," AIMS report goes in a sheet named "Aims," Button and grid go on a "Solutions"
' sheet, incomplete PCRs and issues on the "Solutions" sheet are written to the "Review" sheet, and Metadata gets written to a "Stats" 
' sheet. I'd just upload the file, but there's patient data in there and that's an actual crime.
'
'
' Kind of a niche project TBH
